# websocket

A new Flutter project with SocketIO.

# What is the use of SocketIO?
SocketIO is used when we want to make a full duplex connection between server and client. All the information is shared in realtime. We can connect multiple clients to the server but this is just connecting a single application to the web server.

# How to start the project?
Step 1: Install XAMPP server (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) </br>
Step 2: Install and start your server (You can configure the server credentials). </br>
Step 3: Clone the repository at your desired path.</br>
Step 4: Cut the server.php file and paste it in XAMPP->htdocs.</br>
Step 5: Open url localhost/server.php</br>
Step 6: Start the Flutter app, you can use your platform but if you are making desktop applications for Linux or Windows, you will have to first type the following command (flutter config --enable-<windows/linux/macos>-desktop. Restart your IDE and you will find your packages.</br>
Step 7: Make sure your server is running, start the app.</br>
Step 8: You will see all the messages that you type in realtime.</br>
